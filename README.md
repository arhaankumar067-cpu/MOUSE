# MOUSE
**Air Mouse** (CV2/MediaPipe) tracks the **index fingertip** to move the cursor on screen. It uses **image processing** and **coordinate mapping** for control, and a **thumb-index pinch** gesture (calculated via Euclidean distance) for the left-click action. It incorporates **smoothing** for stable movement.
